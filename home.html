    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>On this site, you can learn very little about me as a person, but you can learn a bit about the kinds of work I'm doing, which obviously does not include formal training in web design.</p>
    <p>You should know at a minimum that I study and teach about computers from a composition and rhetoric perspective, which for me means taking into acount their technical and social elements and contexts. Put another way: my research interests center on digital technology, computation, and pedagogy from a comp/rhet perspective.</p>
    <p>The <a href="projects/hub.html">Projects</a> page is the focus. There, you will find pedagogical materials I've developed for teaching (with) computers in humanities courses, in particular ones that focus on writing and/or digital media.</p>
